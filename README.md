# Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and Sensitivity Analysis (SA) Course

Supplementary material for the introductory course on Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and Sensitivity Analysis (SA)

This course covers the basics of UQ and SA as essential tools for understanding complex systems. The course is intended for graduate students and researchers in engineering and science who are interested in learning about UQ and SA. The course is organized in two parts: (1) Uncertainty Quantification and (2) Sensitivity Analysis. The course is taught using the Python programming language and the Jupyter Notebook environment.

### A Brief Overview of UQ and SA

#### Uncertainty Quantification
Uncertainty Quantification is the process of analyzing and characterizing the uncertainty in a model or simulation. In other words, it involves quantifying how much the output of a model can vary due to uncertainties in the input parameters.

#### Sensitivity Analysis
Sensitivity Analysis is the process of quantifying the effect of input parameter uncertainties on the output of a model. In other words, it involves determining which input parameters have the greatest impact on the model output.
